BITCOIN 
Historical Data Analysis Over The Last 14 Years
Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the volatility and risks associated with Bitcoin over the past 14 years. Using data from the CryptoCompare API(https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/v2/histoday) and an additional dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data), we explore Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, trading volume, and volatility trends. The goal is to test specific hypotheses to better understand Bitcoin’s risk profile as an investment asset.
Dataset Description:
The dataset is a combination of two sources and includes:
•	Time: Date of the daily trading data.
•	Open, High, Low, Close: Prices of Bitcoin at various points in the day.
•	Volume: The amount of Bitcoin traded.
•	VolumeTo: The equivalent USD value of the traded volume.
Mission:
The objective of this analysis is to provide insights into Bitcoin’s market behavior, focusing on volatility and trading patterns.
Hypotheses:
1.	Bitcoin's average closing price is higher in specific seasons.
2.	Bitcoin is more volatile during weekdays compared to weekends.
3.	There is a significant correlation between trading volume and both price movements and volatility.
Data Cleaning Process:
Several steps were taken to prepare the dataset for analysis:
•	Date formatting: Aligned date formats and extracted useful time features (year, season, weekday/weekend).
•	Handling missing data: Addressed gaps in the trading volume and other missing data.
•	Data consistency: Ensured the data was merged accurately across both sources, maintaining consistency in formatting.
Analysis Approach:
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To explore the distribution of prices, trading volumes, and seasonal trends.
•	Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationships between trading volume, price movements, and volatility.
•	Trend Analysis: Analyzed Bitcoin price trends over the years, examining any notable spikes or dips in specific periods.
Results:
•	Hypothesis 1:  "Spring" was identified, with Bitcoin prices higher during the spring compared to other seasons.
•	Hypothesis 2: Weekdays indeed show higher volatility compared to weekends.
•	Hypothesis 3: No significant correlation was found between trading volume and price movements or volatility.
•	A high standard deviation of volatility implies that Bitcoin has large swings in daily price, reinforcing the notion that it is a risky asset. A volatile market is more unpredictable and can lead to sudden price shifts
These findings provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's inherent volatility and its limited correlation with trading volume, helping investors assess the associated risks.
